**Regression discontinuity design:** A quasiâ€“experimental comparison to estimate a treatment effect where units are assigned to treatment conditions based on a cut-off score on a quantitative assignment variable (aka running variable).

**Synthetic control method:** The synthetic control method is a statistical method used to evaluate the effect of an intervention in comparative case studies. It involves the construction of a weighted combination of groups used as controls, to which the treatment group is compared.
