   ANCOVA
      Analysis of covariance is a simple linear model, typically with one continuous predictor (the covariate) and a catgeorical variable (which may correspond to treatment or control group). In the context of this package, ANCOVA could be useful in pre-post treatment designs, either with or without random assignment. This is similar to the approach of difference in differences, but only applicable with a single pre and post treatment measure.

   Average treatment effect
   ATE
      The average treatement effect across all units.

   Average treatment effect on the treated
   ATT
      The average effect of the treatment on the units that recieved it. Also called Treatment on the treated.

   Change score analysis
      A statistical procedure where the outcome variable is the difference between the posttest and protest scores.

   Comparative interrupted time-series design
   CITS
      An interrupted time series design with added comparison time series observations.

   Confound
      Anything besides the treatment which varies across the treatment and control conditions.

   Counterfactual
      A hypothetical outcome that could or will occur under specific hypothetical circumstances.

   Difference in differences
   DiD
      Analysis where the treatment effect is estimated as a difference between treatment conditions in the differences between pre-treatment to post treatment observations.

   Interrupted time series design
   ITS
      A quasi-experimental design to estimate a treatment effect where a series of observations are collected before and after a treatment. No control group is present.

   Non-equivalent group designs
   NEGD
      A quasi-experimental design where units are assigned to conditions non-randomly, and not according to a running variable (see Regression discontinuity design).

   One-group posttest-only design
      A design where a single group is exposed to a treatment and assessed on an outcome measure. There is no pretest measure or comparison group.

   Panel data
      Time series data collected on multiple units where the same units are observed at each time point.

   Pretest-posttest design
      A quasi-experimental design where the treatment effect is estimated by comparing an outcome measure before and after treatment.

   Quasi-experiment
      An empirical comparison used to estimate the effects of a treatment where units are not assigned to conditions at random.

   Random assignment
      Where units are assigned to conditions at random.

   Randomized experiment
      An emprical comparison used to estimate the effects of treatments where units are assigned to treatment conditions randomly.

   Regression discontinuity design
      A quasiâ€“experimental comparison to estimate a treatment effect where units are assigned to treatment conditions based on a cut-off score on a quantitative assignment variable (aka running variable).

   Sharp regression discontinuity design
      A Regression discontinuity design where allocation to treatment or control is determined by a sharp threshold / step function.

   Synthetic control method
      The synthetic control method is a statistical method used to evaluate the effect of an intervention in comparative case studies. It involves the construction of a weighted combination of groups used as controls, to which the treatment group is compared.

   Treatment on the treated effect
   TOT
      The average effect of the treatment on the units that recieved it. Also called the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).

   Treatment effect
      The difference in outcomes between what happened after a treatment is implemented and what would have happened (see Counterfactual) if the treatment had not been implemented, assuming everything else had been the same.

   Wilkinson notation
      A notation for describing statistical models :footcite:p:`wilkinson1973symbolic`.
